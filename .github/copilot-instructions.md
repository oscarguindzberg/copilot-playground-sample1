# Project general coding guidelines

## Code Structure
- Follow the existing file structure: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
- Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in their respective files.
## HTML Guidelines
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.) to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) are keyboard accessible.
- Use ARIA attributes where necessary to improve accessibility.
## CSS Guidelines
- Use modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid) for layout.
- Follow a mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Use CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain consistency.
- Comment your CSS code to explain complex styles or sections.
## JavaScript Guidelines
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Use ES6+ features (let/const, arrow functions, template literals, etc.).
- Ensure proper error handling and input validation.
- Use comments to explain complex logic or functions.
- Follow accessibility best practices when manipulating the DOM (e.g., updating `aria-live` regions).
## General Best Practices
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Test your code across different browsers and devices for compatibility.
- Ensure that any new features or changes do not break existing functionality.
- Keep performance in mind; optimize code for speed and efficiency where possible.
- Document any new features or changes in the README.md file.
